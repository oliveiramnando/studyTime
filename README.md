# StudyTime
A Chrome extension that helps you track study sessions and calculates break durations dynamically based on your focus time.

# Why I Built This
I initially used the Pomodoro Method but found myself checking my phone for the timer quite often. Switching to a stopwatch-based approach, where I would study as long as I could, take a break for a third of that time, was more flexible but tedious to track manually. StudyTime automates this process, allowing for a distraction-free workflow.

# Features
* Tracks study duration
* Calculates optimal break time based on session length
* Reduces the need to check external timers
* Simple, lightweight, and easy to use

# Lessons Learned
Building StudyTime taught me:
* How Chrome extensions work, including permissions and the manifest file
* Using the Chrome Storage API to persist data
* Implementing notifications with the Chrome Notification API
* Enabling communication between script.js and background.js using event listeners
